# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 747: [Largest Number At Least Twice of Others][task]

Description
-----------

> You are given an integer array `nums` where the largest integer is unique.
> 
> Determine whether the largest element in the array is **at least twice** as much as every other number in the array.
> If it is, return _the **index** of the largest element, or return `-1` otherwise_.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: nums = [3,6,1,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: 6 is the largest integer.
    For every other number in the array x, 6 is at least twice as big as x.
    The index of value 6 is 1, so we return 1.
