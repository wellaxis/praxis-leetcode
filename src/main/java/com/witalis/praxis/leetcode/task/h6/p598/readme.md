# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 598: [Range Addition II][task]

Description
-----------

> You are given an `m x n` matrix `M` initialized with all `0`'s and an array of operations `ops`,
> where `ops[i] = [ai, bi]` means `M[x][y]` should be incremented by one for all `0 <= x < ai` and `0 <= y < bi`.
> 
> Count and return _the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations_.
