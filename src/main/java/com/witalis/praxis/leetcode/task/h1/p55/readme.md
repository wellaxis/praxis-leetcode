# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 55: [Jump Game][task]

Description
-----------

> You are given an integer array `nums`.
> You are initially positioned at the array's **first index**,
> and each element in the array represents your
> maximum jump length at that position.
> 
> Return `true` _if you can reach the last index_, or `false` otherwise.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1,
             then 3 steps to the last index.

Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what.
             Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes
             it impossible to reach the last index.
```
