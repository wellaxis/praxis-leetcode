# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 823: [Binary Trees With Factors][task]

Description
-----------

> Given an array of unique integers, `arr`, where each integer `arr[i]` is strictly greater than `1`.
> 
> We make a binary tree using these integers, and each number may be used for any number of times.
> Each non-leaf node's value should be equal to the product of the values of its children.
> 
> _Return the number of binary trees we can make_. The answer may be too large so return the answer **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: arr = [2,4,5,10]
Output: 7
Explanation: We can make these trees: [2], [4], [5], [10], [4, 2, 2], [10, 2, 5], [10, 5, 2].
```
