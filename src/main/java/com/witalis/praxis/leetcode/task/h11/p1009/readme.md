Description
-----------

> The **complement** of an integer is the integer you get when you flip
> all the `0`'s to `1`'s and all the `1`'s to `0`'s in its binary representation.
> 
> * For example, The integer `5` is `"101"` in binary and its **complement** is `"010"` which is the integer `2`.
> 
> Given an integer `n`, _return its complement_.
