Description
-----------

> You are given an integer array `score` of size `n`, where `score[i]` is the score
> of the `i^th` athlete in a competition. All the scores are guaranteed to be **unique**.
> 
> The athletes are **placed** based on their scores, where the `1st` place athlete has the highest score,
> the `2nd` place athlete has the `2nd` highest score, and so on.
> The placement of each athlete determines their rank:
> * The `1st` place athlete's rank is `"Gold Medal"`.
> * The `2nd` place athlete's rank is `"Silver Medal"`.
> * The `3rd` place athlete's rank is `"Bronze Medal"`.
> * For the `4th` place to the `nth` place athlete, their rank is their placement number
> (i.e., the `xth` place athlete's rank is `"x"`).
> 
> Return an array `answer` of size `n` where `answer[i]` is the **rank** of the `ith` athlete.
