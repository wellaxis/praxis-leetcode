# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 1218: [Longest Arithmetic Subsequence of Given Difference][task]

Description
-----------

> Given an integer array `arr` and an integer `difference`,
> return _the length of the longest subsequence in `arr` which is an arithmetic sequence
> such that the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence equals difference_.
> 
> A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from `arr`
> by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: arr = [1,5,7,8,5,3,4,2,1], difference = -2
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [7,5,3,1].
```

Solution
--------
