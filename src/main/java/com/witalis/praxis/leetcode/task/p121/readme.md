# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 121: [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock][task]

Description
-----------

> You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]`
> is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.
> 
> You want to maximize your profit by choosing
> a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing
> a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.
> 
> Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_.
> If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6),
             profit = 6-1 = 5. Note that buying on day 2 and selling
             on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```
