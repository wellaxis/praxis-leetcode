# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 1356: [Sort Integers by The Number of 1 Bits][task]

Description
-----------

> You are given an integer array `arr`. Sort the integers in the array in ascending order
> by the number of `1`'s in their binary representation and in case of two or more integers
> have the same number of `1`'s you have to sort them in ascending order.
> 
> Return _the array after sorting it_.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: arr = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]
Explantion: [0] is the only integer with 0 bits.
    [1,2,4,8] all have 1 bit.
    [3,5,6] have 2 bits.
    [7] has 3 bits.
    The sorted array by bits is [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]
```
