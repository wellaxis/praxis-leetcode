# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 187: [Repeated DNA Sequences][task]

Description
-----------

> The **DNA sequence** is composed of a series of nucleotides
> abbreviated as `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`.
> * For example, `"ACGAATTCCG"` is a **DNA sequence**.
> 
> When studying **DNA**, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.
> 
> Given a string `s` that represents a **DNA sequence**,
> return all the **`10`-letter-long** sequences (substrings)
> that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.
> You may return the answer in **any order**.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]
```
