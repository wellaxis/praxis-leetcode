# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 697: [Degree of an Array][task]

Description
-----------

> Given a non-empty array of non-negative integers `nums`,
> the **degree** of this array is defined as the maximum frequency of any one of its elements.
> 
> Your task is to find the smallest possible length of a (contiguous) subarray of `nums`,
> that has the same degree as nums.

 Example
-------

```sh
Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
    The input array has a degree of 2 because both elements 1 and 2 appear twice.
    Of the subarrays that have the same degree:
    [1, 2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 2]
    The shortest length is 2. So return 2.
```
