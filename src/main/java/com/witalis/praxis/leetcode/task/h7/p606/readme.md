# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 606: [Construct String from Binary Tree][task]

Description
-----------

> Given the `root` of a binary tree, construct a string consisting of parenthesis
> and integers from a binary tree with the preorder traversal way, and return it.
> 
> Omit all the empty parenthesis pairs that do not affect the one-to-one mapping
> relationship between the string and the original binary tree.

 Example
-------

```sh
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4]
Output: "1(2()(4))(3)"
Explanation: Almost the same as the first example, except we cannot omit the first parenthesis pair
    to break the one-to-one mapping relationship between the input and the output.
```
