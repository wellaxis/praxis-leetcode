# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 236: [Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree][task]

Description
-----------

> Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
> 
> According to the `definition of LCA on Wikipedia`:
> “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T`
> that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”
