# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 482: [License Key Formatting][task]

Description
-----------

> You are given a license key represented as a string `s`
> that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes.
> The string is separated into `n + 1` groups by `n` dashes. You are also given an integer `k`.
> 
> We want to reformat the string `s` such that each group contains exactly `k` characters,
> except for the first group, which could be shorter than `k` but still must contain at least one character.
> Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups,
> and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.
> 
> Return _the reformatted license key_.

 Example
-------

```sh
Input: s = "2-5g-3-J", k = 2
Output: "2-5G-3J"
Explanation: The string s has been split into three parts,
    each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.
```
