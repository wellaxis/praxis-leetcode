# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 762: [Prime Number of Set Bits in Binary Representation][task]

Description
-----------

> Given two integers `left` and `right`, return _the **count** of numbers in the **inclusive** range `[left, right]`
> having a **prime number of set bits** in their binary representation_.
> 
> Recall that the **number of set bits** an integer has is the number of `1`'s present when written in binary.
> 
> * For example, `21` written in binary is `10101`, which has `3` set bits.


Example
-------

```sh
Input: left = 10, right = 15
Output: 5
Explanation:
    10 -> 1010 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
    11 -> 1011 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
    12 -> 1100 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
    13 -> 1101 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
    14 -> 1110 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
    15 -> 1111 (4 set bits, 4 is not prime)
    5 numbers have a prime number of set bits.
```
