# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 815: [Bus Routes][task]

Description
-----------

> You are given an array `routes` representing bus routes where `routes[i]` is a bus route that the `i^th` bus repeats forever.
> 
> * For example, if `routes[0] = [1, 5, 7]`, this means that the `0^th` bus travels
> in the sequence `1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> ...` forever.
>
> You will start at the bus stop `source` (You are not on any bus initially),
> and you want to go to the bus stop `target`. You can travel between bus stops by buses only.
> 
> Return _the least number of buses you must take to travel from `source` to `target`_. Return `-1` if it is not possible.

 Example
-------

```sh
Input: routes = [[1,2,7],[3,6,7]], source = 1, target = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: The best strategy is take the first bus to the bus stop 7, then take the second bus to the bus stop 6.
```
