# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 1184: [Distance Between Bus Stops][task]

Description
-----------

> A bus has `n` stops numbered from `0` to `n - 1` that form a circle.
> We know the distance between all pairs of neighboring stops where
> `distance[i]` is the distance between the stops number `i` and `(i + 1) % n`.
> 
> The bus goes along both directions i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise.
> 
> Return _the shortest distance between the given `start` and `destination` stops_.
