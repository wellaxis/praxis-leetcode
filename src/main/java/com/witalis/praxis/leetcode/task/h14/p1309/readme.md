# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 1309: [Decrypt String from Alphabet to Integer Mapping][task]

Description
-----------

> You are given a string `s` formed by digits and `'#'`.
> We want to map `s` to English lowercase characters as follows:
> * Characters (`'a'` to `'i'`) are represented by (`'1'` to `'9'`) respectively.
> * Characters (`'j'` to `'z'`) are represented by (`'10#'` to `'26#'`) respectively.
> 
> Return _the string formed after mapping_.
> 
> The test cases are generated so that a unique mapping will always exist.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: s = "10#11#12"
Output: "jkab"
Explanation: "j" -> "10#" , "k" -> "11#" , "a" -> "1" , "b" -> "2".
```
