# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 328: [Odd Even Linked List][task]

Description
-----------

> Given the `head` of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together
> followed by the nodes with even indices, and return _the reordered list_.
> 
> The **first** node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.
> 
> Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
> 
> You must solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` time complexity.
