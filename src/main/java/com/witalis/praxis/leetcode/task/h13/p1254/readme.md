-----------

> Given a 2D `grid` consists of `0s` (land) and `1s` (water).
> An `island` is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of `0s`
> and a `closed island` is an island **totally** (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by `1s`.
> 
> Return _the number of closed islands_.

```sh
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],[1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]]
Output: 2

```
