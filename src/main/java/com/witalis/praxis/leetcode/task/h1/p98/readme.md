# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 98: [Validate Binary Search Tree][task]

Description
-----------

> Given the `root` of a binary tree,
> _determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST)_.
> 
> A **valid BST** is defined as follows:
> * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
> * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
> * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
