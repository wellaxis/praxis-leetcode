Description
-----------

> Write a function to **delete a node** in a singly-linked list.
> You will **not** be given access to the `head` of the list,
> instead you will be given access to **the node to be deleted** directly.
> 
> It is **guaranteed** that the node to be deleted is **not a tail node** in the list.

Example
