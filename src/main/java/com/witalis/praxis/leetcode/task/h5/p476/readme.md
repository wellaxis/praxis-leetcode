# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 476: [Number Complement][task]

Description
-----------

> The **complement** of an integer is the integer you get when
> you flip all the `0`'s to `1`'s and all the `1`'s to `0`'s in its binary representation.
> * For example, The integer `5` is `"101"` in binary and its complement is `"010"` which is the integer `2`.
>
> Given an integer `num`, return its complement.

 Example
-------

```sh
Input: num = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
```
