# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 717: [1-bit and 2-bit Characters][task]

Description
-----------

> We have two special characters:
> * The first character can be represented by one bit `0`.
> * The second character can be represented by two bits (`10` or `11`).
>
> Given a binary array `bits` that ends with `0`,
> return _`true` if the last character must be a `one`-bit character_.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: bits = [1,0,0]
Output: true
Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character.
So the last character is one-bit character.
```
