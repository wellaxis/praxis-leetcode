# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 926: [Flip String to Monotone Increasing][task]

Description
-----------

> A binary string is monotone increasing if it consists of some number of
> `0`'s (possibly none), followed by some number of `1`'s (also possibly none).
> 
> You are given a binary string `s`.
> You can flip `s[i]` changing it from `0` to `1` or from `1` to `0`.
> 
> Return _the minimum number of flips to make `s` monotone increasing_.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: s = "010110"
Output: 2
Explanation: We flip to get 011111, or alternatively 000111.
```
