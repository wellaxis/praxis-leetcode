# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 841: [Keys and Rooms][task]

Description
-----------

> There are `n` rooms labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and all the rooms are locked except for room `0`.
> Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.
> 
> When you visit a room, you may find a set of **distinct keys** in it.
> Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks,
> and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.
> 
> Given an array `rooms` where `rooms[i]` is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room `i`,
> return _`true` if you can visit **all** the rooms, or `false` otherwise_.

 Example
-------

```sh
Input: rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
Output: false
Explanation: We can not enter room number 2 since the only key that unlocks it is in that room.
```
