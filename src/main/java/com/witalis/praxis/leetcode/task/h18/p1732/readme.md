# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 1732: [Find the Highest Altitude][task]

Description
-----------

> There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of `n + 1` points at different altitudes.
> The biker starts his trip on point `0` with altitude equal `0`.
> 
> You are given an integer array `gain` of length `n` where `gain[i]` is the **net gain in altitude**
> between points `i` and `i + 1` for all (`0 <= i < n`). Return _the **highest altitude** of a point_.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]
Output: 1
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]. The highest is 1.
