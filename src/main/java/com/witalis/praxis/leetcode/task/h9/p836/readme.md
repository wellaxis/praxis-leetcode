# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 836: [Rectangle Overlap][task]

Description
-----------

> An axis-aligned rectangle is represented as a list `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`,
> where `(x1, y1)` is the coordinate of its bottom-left corner,
> and `(x2, y2)` is the coordinate of its top-right corner.
> Its top and bottom edges are parallel to the X-axis,
> and its left and right edges are parallel to the Y-axis.
> 
> Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is **positive**.
> To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.
> 
> Given two axis-aligned rectangles `rec1` and `rec2`,
> return _`true` if they overlap, otherwise return `false`_.

 Example
-------

```sh
Input: rec1 = [0,0,2,2], rec2 = [1,1,3,3]
Output: true
```
