# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 128: [Longest Consecutive Sequence][task]

Description
-----------

> Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`,
> return _the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence_.
> 
> You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
