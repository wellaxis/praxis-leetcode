# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 69: [Sqrt(x)][task]

Description
-----------

> Given a non-negative integer `x`, compute and return _the square root of_ `x`.
> 
> Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are **truncated**,
> and only **the integer part** of the result is returned.
> 
> **Note:** You are not allowed to use any built-in exponent function
> or operator, such as `pow(x, 0.5)` or `x ** 0.5`.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842...,
             and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```
