Description
-----------

> You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`.
> Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`.
> If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.
> 
> Return _the merged string_.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s
```
