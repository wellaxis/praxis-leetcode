# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 1502: [Can Make Arithmetic Progression From Sequence][task]

Description
-----------

> A sequence of numbers is called an **arithmetic progression**
> if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.
> 
> Given an array of numbers `arr`, return _`true` if the array can be rearranged
> to form an **arithmetic progression**. Otherwise, return `false`_.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: arr = [3,5,1]
Output: true
Explanation: We can reorder the elements as [1,3,5] or [5,3,1]
    with differences 2 and -2 respectively, between each consecutive elements.
```
