# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 735: [Asteroid Collision][task]

Description
-----------

> We are given an array `asteroids` of integers representing asteroids in a row.
> 
> For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction
> (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.
> 
> Find out _the state of the asteroids after all collisions_. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode.
> If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: asteroids = [10,2,-5]
Output: [10]
Explanation: The 2 and -5 collide resulting in -5. The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10.
```
