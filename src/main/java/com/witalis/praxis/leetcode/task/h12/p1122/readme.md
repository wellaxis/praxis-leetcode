# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 1122: [Relative Sort Array][task]

Description
-----------

> Given two arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, the elements of `arr2` are distinct, and all elements in `arr2` are also in `arr1`.
> 
> Sort the elements of `arr1` such that the relative ordering of items in `arr1` are the same as in `arr2`.
> Elements that do not appear in `arr2` should be placed at the end of `arr1` in **ascending** order.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: arr1 = [2,3,1,3,2,4,6,7,9,2,19], arr2 = [2,1,4,3,9,6]
