# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 374: [Guess Number Higher or Lower][task]

Description
-----------

> We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
> 
> I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
> 
> Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether
> the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.
> 
> You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`,
> which returns three possible results:
> * -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. `num > pick`).
> * 1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. `num < pick`).
> * 0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. `num == pick`).
> 
> Return _the number that I picked_.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```
