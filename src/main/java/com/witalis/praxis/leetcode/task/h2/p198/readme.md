# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 198: [House Robber][task]

Description
-----------

> You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street.
> Each house has a certain amount of money stashed,
> the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them
> is that adjacent houses have security systems connected, and
> **it will automatically contact the police
> if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.
> 
> Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house,
> return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```

> Constraints:
> * The input must be a **binary string** of length `32`.

> Follow up:
> If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
