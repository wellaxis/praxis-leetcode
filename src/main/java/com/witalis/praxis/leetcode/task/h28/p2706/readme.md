# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 2706: [Buy Two Chocolates][task]

Description
-----------

> You are given an integer array `prices` representing the prices of various chocolates in a store.
> You are also given a single integer `money`, which represents your initial amount of money.
> 
> You must buy **exactly** two chocolates in such a way that you still have some **non-negative** leftover money.
> You would like to minimize the sum of the prices of the two chocolates you buy.
> 
> Return _the amount of money you will have leftover after buying the two chocolates_.
> If there is no way for you to buy two chocolates without ending up in debt, return `money`.
> Note that the leftover must be non-negative.

 Example
-------

```sh
Input: prices = [1,2,2], money = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: Purchase the chocolates priced at 1 and 2 units respectively. You will have 3 - 3 = 0 units of money afterwards. Thus, we return 0.
```
