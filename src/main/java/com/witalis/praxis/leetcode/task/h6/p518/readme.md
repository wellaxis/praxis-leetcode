# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 518: [Coin Change II][task]

Description
-----------

> You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations
> and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.
> 
> Return _the number of combinations that make up that amount_.
> If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `0`.
> 
> You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
> 
> The answer is **guaranteed** to fit into a signed **32-bit** integer.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: amount = 5, coins = [1,2,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
    5=5
    5=2+2+1
    5=2+1+1+1
    5=1+1+1+1+1
```
