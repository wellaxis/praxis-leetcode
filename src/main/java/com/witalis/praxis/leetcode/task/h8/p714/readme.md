# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 714: [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee][task]

Description
-----------

> You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i^th` day,
> and an integer `fee` representing a transaction fee.
> 
> Find the **maximum** profit you can achieve.
> You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.
> 
> **Note**: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example
-------

```sh
Input: prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
    - Buying at prices[0] = 1
    - Selling at prices[3] = 8
    - Buying at prices[4] = 4
    - Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
```
