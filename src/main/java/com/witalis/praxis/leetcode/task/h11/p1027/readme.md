# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 1027: [Longest Arithmetic Subsequence][task]

Description
-----------

> Given an array `nums` of integers, return _the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in `nums`_.
> 
> **Note** that:
> * A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some
> or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
> * A sequence `seq` is arithmetic if `seq[i + 1] - seq[i]` are all the same value (for `0 <= i < seq.length - 1`).

Example
