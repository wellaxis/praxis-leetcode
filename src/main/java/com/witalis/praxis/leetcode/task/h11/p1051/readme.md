# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 1051: [Height Checker][task]

Description
-----------

> A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line
> in **non-decreasing order** by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array `expected`
> where `expected[i]` is the expected height of the `i^th` student in line.
> 
> You are given an integer array `heights` representing the **current order** that the students are standing in.
> Each `heights[i]` is the height of the `i^th` student in line (**0-indexed**).
> 
> Return _the **number of indices** where `heights[i] != expected[i]`_.

Example

```sh
Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
    heights:  [1,1,4,2,1,3]
    expected: [1,1,1,2,3,4]
    Indices 2, 4, and 5 do not match.
```
