# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 1175: [Prime Arrangements][task]

Description
-----------

> Return the number of permutations of 1 to `n` so that prime numbers are at prime indices (1-indexed.)
> 
> _(Recall that an integer is prime if and only if it is greater than 1,
> and cannot be written as a product of two positive integers both smaller than it.)_
> 
> Since the answer may be large, return the answer **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

 Example
-------

```sh
Input: n = 5
Output: 12
Explanation: For example [1,2,5,4,3] is a valid permutation, but [5,2,3,4,1] is not because the prime number 5 is at index 1.
```
