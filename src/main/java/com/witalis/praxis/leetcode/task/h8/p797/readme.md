# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 797: [All Paths From Source to Target][task]

Description
-----------

> Given a directed acyclic graph (**DAG**) of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`,
> find all possible paths from node `0` to node `n - 1` and return them in **any order**.
> 
> The graph is given as follows: `graph[i]` is a list of all nodes you can visit from node `i`
> (i.e., there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `graph[i][j]`).

Example
-------

```sh
Input: graph = [[4,3,1],[3,2,4],[3],[4],[]]
Output: [[0,4],[0,3,4],[0,1,3,4],[0,1,2,3,4],[0,1,4]]
```
