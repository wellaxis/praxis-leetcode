# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 275: [H-Index II][task]

Description
-----------

> Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations
> a researcher received for their `i^th` paper and `citations` is sorted in an **ascending order**,
> return compute the researcher's `h`-index.
> 
> According to the **definition of h-index on Wikipedia**:
> A scientist has an index `h` if `h` of their `n` papers have at least `h` citations each,
> and the other `n âˆ’ h` papers have no more than `h` citations each.
> 
> If there are several possible values for `h`, the maximum one is taken as the `h`-index.
> 
> You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total
    and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
    Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each
    and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
```
