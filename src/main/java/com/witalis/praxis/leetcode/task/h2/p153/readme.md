# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 153: [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array][task]

Description
-----------

> Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times.
> For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:
> * `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
> * `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.
>
> Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time
> results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.
> 
> Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return _the minimum element of this array_.
> 
> You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```
