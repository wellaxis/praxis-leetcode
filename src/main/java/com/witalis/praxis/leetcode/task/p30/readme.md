# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 30: [Substring with Concatenation of All Words][task]

Description
-----------

> You are given a string `s` and
> an array of strings `words` of **the same length**.
> Return all starting indices of substring(s) in `s`
> that is a concatenation of each word in `words`
> **exactly once, in any order**,
> and **without any intervening characters**.
>
> You can return the answer in **any order**.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: s = "barfoothefoobarman", words = ["foo","bar"]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9
             are "barfoo" and "foobar" respectively.
             The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
```
