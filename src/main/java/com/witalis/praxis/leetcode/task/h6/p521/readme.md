# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 521: [Longest Uncommon Subsequence I][task]

Description
-----------

> Given two strings `a` and `b`, return _the length of the **longest uncommon subsequence**
> between `a` and `b`. If the longest uncommon subsequence does not exist, return `-1`.
> 
> An **uncommon subsequence** between two strings is a string that is a **subsequence of one but not the other**.
> 
> A **subsequence** of a string `s` is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from `s`.
> 
> * For example, `"abc"` is a subsequence of `"aebdc"`
> because you can delete the underlined characters in `"aebdc"` to get `"abc"`.
> Other subsequences of `"aebdc"` include `"aebdc"`, `"aeb"`, and `""` (empty string).

 Example
-------

```sh
Input: a = "aba", b = "cdc"
Output: 3
Explanation: One longest uncommon subsequence is "aba" because "aba" is a subsequence of "aba" but not "cdc".
    Note that "cdc" is also a longest uncommon subsequence.
```
