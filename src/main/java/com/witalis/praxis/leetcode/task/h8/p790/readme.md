# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 790: [Domino and Tromino Tiling][task]

Description
-----------

> You have two types of tiles: a `2 x 1` domino shape and a tromino shape.
> You may rotate these shapes.
> 
> ![tile.png](image/tile.png)
> 
> Given an integer `n`, return _the number of ways to tile an `2 x n` board_.
> Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.
> 
> In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile.
> Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board
> such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.
