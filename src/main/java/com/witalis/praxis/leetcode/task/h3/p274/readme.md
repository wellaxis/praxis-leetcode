# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 274: [H-Index][task]

Description
-----------

> Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations
> a researcher received for their `i^th` paper, return compute the researcher's `h`-index.
> 
> According to the **definition of h-index on Wikipedia**:
> A scientist has an index `h` if `h` of their `n` papers have at least `h` citations each,
> and the other `n âˆ’ h` papers have no more than `h` citations each.
> 
> If there are several possible values for `h`, the maximum one is taken as the `h`-index.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total
    and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
    Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each
    and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
```
