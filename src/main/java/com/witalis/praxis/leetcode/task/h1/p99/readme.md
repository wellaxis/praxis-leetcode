# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 99: [Recover Binary Search Tree][task]

> You are given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST),
> where the values of **exactly** two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake.
> _Recover the tree without changing its structure_.

 Example
-------

```sh
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,null,2]
Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]
Explanation: 2 cannot be in the right subtree of 3 because 2 < 3.
             Swapping 2 and 3 makes the BST valid.
```
