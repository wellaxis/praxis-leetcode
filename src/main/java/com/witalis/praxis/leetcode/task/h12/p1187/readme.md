# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 1187: [Make Array Strictly Increasing][task]

Description
-----------

> Given two integer arrays `arr1` and `arr2`,
> return _the minimum number of operations (possibly zero) needed to make `arr1` strictly increasing_.
> 
> In one operation, you can choose two indices `0 <= i < arr1.length` and `0 <= j < arr2.length`
> and do the assignment `arr1[i] = arr2[j]`.
> 
> If there is no way to make `arr1` strictly increasing, return `-1`.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: arr1 = [1,5,3,6,7], arr2 = [4,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Replace 5 with 3 and then replace 3 with 4. arr1 = [1, 3, 4, 6, 7].
```
