# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 93: [Restore IP Addresses][task]

Description
-----------

> A **valid IP address** consists of exactly four integers separated by single dots.
> Each integer is between `0` and `255` (**inclusive**) and cannot have leading zeros.
> * For example, `"0.1.2.201"` and `"192.168.1.1"` are **valid** IP addresses,
> but `"0.011.255.245"`, `"192.168.1.312"` and `"192.168@1.1"` are **invalid** IP addresses.

> Given a string `s` containing only digits,
> return _all possible valid IP addresses
> that can be formed by inserting dots into `s`_.
> You are **not** allowed to reorder or remove any digits in s.
> You may return the valid IP addresses in **any** order.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: s = "25525511135"
Output: ["255.255.11.135","255.255.111.35"]
```
