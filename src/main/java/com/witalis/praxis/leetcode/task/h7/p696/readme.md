# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 696: [Count Binary Substrings][task]

Description
-----------

> Given a binary string `s`,
> return the number of non-empty substrings that have the same number of `0`'s and `1`'s,
> and all the `0`'s and all the `1`'s in these substrings are grouped consecutively.
> 
> Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: s = "00110011"
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".
    Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.
    Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.
```
