> You have a set of integers `s`, which originally contains all the numbers from `1` to `n`.
> Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in `s` got duplicated to another number in the set,
> which results in **repetition of one** number and **loss of another** number.
> 
> You are given an integer array `nums` representing the data status of this set after the error.
> 
> Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return _them in the form of an array_.

Input: nums = [1,2,2,4]
