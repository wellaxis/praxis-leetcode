# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 68: [Text Justification][task]

Description
-----------

> Given an array of strings `words` and a width `maxWidth`,
> format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth`
> characters and is fully (left and right) justified.
> 
> You should pack your words in a greedy approach;
> that is, pack as many words as you can in each line.
> Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary
> so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters.
> 
> Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible.
> If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words,
> the empty slots on the left will be assigned
> more spaces than the slots on the right.
> 
> For the last line of text, it should be left-justified
> and no extra space is inserted between words.
> 
> Note:
> * A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
> * Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
> * The input array words contains at least one word.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain","to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"], maxWidth = 20
Output:
[
  "Science  is  what we",
  "understand      well",
  "enough to explain to",
  "a  computer.  Art is",
  "everything  else  we",
  "do                  "
]
```
