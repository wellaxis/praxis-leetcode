# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 2348: [Number of Zero-Filled Subarrays][task]

Description
-----------

> Given an integer array `nums`, return _the number of **subarrays** filled with `0`_.
> 
> A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

 Example
-------

```sh
Input: nums = [1,3,0,0,2,0,0,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
    There are 4 occurrences of [0] as a subarray.
    There are 2 occurrences of [0,0] as a subarray.
    There is no occurrence of a subarray with a size more than 2 filled with 0. Therefore, we return 6.
```
