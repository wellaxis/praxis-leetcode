# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 2849: [Determine if a Cell Is Reachable at a Given Time][task]

Description
-----------

> You are given four integers `sx`, `sy`, `fx`, `fy`, and a **non-negative** integer `t`.
> 
> In an infinite 2D grid, you start at the cell `(sx, sy)`. Each second, you **must** move to any of its adjacent cells.
> 
> Return _`true` if you can reach cell `(fx, fy)` after **exactly** `t` **seconds**, or `false` otherwise_.
> 
> A cell's **adjacent cells** are the 8 cells around it that share at least one corner with it.
> You can visit the same cell several times.

 Example

```sh
Input: sx = 2, sy = 4, fx = 7, fy = 7, t = 6
Output: true
Explanation: Starting at cell (2, 4), we can reach cell (7, 7) in exactly 6 seconds by going through the cells depicted in the picture above. 
```
