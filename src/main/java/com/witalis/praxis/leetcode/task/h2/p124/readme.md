# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 124: [Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum][task]

Description
-----------

> A **path** in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence
> has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence **at most once**.
> Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.
> 
> The **path sum** of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.
> 
> Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the maximum **path sum** of any **non-empty** path_.

 Example

```sh
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
```
