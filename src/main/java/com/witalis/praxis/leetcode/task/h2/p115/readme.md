# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 115: [Distinct Subsequences][task]

Description
-----------

> Given two strings `s` and `t`, return _the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t`_.
> 
> A string's **subsequence** is a new string formed from the original string
> by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the remaining characters' relative positions.
> (i.e., `"ACE"` is a subsequence of `"ABCDE"` while `"AEC"` is not).
> 
> The test cases are generated so that the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: s = "babgbag", t = "bag"
Output: 5
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
'ba'b'g'bag
'ba'bgba'g'
'b'abgb'ag'
ba'b'gb'ag'
