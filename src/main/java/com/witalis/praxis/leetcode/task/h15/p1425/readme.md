# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 1425: [Constrained Subsequence Sum][task]

Description
-----------

> Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`,
> return _the maximum sum of a **non-empty** subsequence of that array
> such that for every two **consecutive** integers in the subsequence,
> `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`, where `i < j`, the condition `j - i <= k` is satisfied.
> 
> A **subsequence** of an array is obtained by deleting some number of elements (can be zero) from the array,
> leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: nums = [10,2,-10,5,20], k = 2
Output: 37
Explanation: The subsequence is [10, 2, 5, 20].
```
