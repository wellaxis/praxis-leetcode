# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 830: [Positions of Large Groups][task]

Description
-----------

> In a string `s` of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character.
> 
> For example, a string like `s = "abbxxxxzyy"` has the groups `"a"`, `"bb"`, `"xxxx"`, `"z"`, and `"yy"`.
> 
> A group is identified by an interval `[start, end]`, where `start` and `end` denote the start and end indices
> (**inclusive**) of the group. In the above example, `"xxxx"` has the interval `[3,6]`.
> 
> A group is considered **large* if it has 3 or more characters.
> 
> Return _the intervals of every **large** group sorted in **increasing order by start index**_.

-------

```sh
Input: s = "abcdddeeeeaabbbcd"
Output: [[3,5],[6,9],[12,14]]
