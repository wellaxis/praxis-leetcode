# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 1759: [Count Number of Homogenous Substrings][task]

Description
-----------

> Given a string `s`, return _the number of **homogenous** substrings of `s`_.
> Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.
> 
> A string is **homogenous** if all the characters of the string are the same.
> 
> A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: s = "abbcccaa"
Output: 13
Explanation: The homogenous substrings are listed as below:
    "a"   appears 3 times.
    "aa"  appears 1 time.
    "b"   appears 2 times.
    "bb"  appears 1 time.
    "c"   appears 3 times.
    "cc"  appears 2 times.
    "ccc" appears 1 time.
    3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 13.
```
