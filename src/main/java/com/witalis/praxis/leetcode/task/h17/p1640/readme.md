# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 1640: [Check Array Formation Through Concatenation][task]

Description
-----------

> You are given an array of distinct integers arr and an array of integer arrays pieces,
> where the integers in pieces are distinct.
> Your goal is to form arr by concatenating the arrays in pieces in any order.
> However, you are not allowed to reorder the integers in each array pieces[i].
>
> Return true if it is possible to form the array arr from pieces. Otherwise, return false.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: arr = [91,4,64,78], pieces = [[78],[4,64],[91]]
Output: true
Explanation: Concatenate [91] then [4,64] then [78]
```
