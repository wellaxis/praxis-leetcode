# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 300: [Longest Increasing Subsequence][task]

Description
-----------

> Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.
> 
> A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements
> without changing the order of the remaining elements.
> For example, `[3,6,2,7]` is a subsequence of the array `[0,3,1,6,2,2,7]`.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
```
