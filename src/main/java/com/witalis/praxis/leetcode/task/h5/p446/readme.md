# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 446: [Arithmetic Slices II - Subsequence][task]

Description
-----------

> Given an integer array `nums`, return _the number of all the **arithmetic subsequences** of `nums`_.
> 
> A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of **at least three elements**
> and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.
> * For example, `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, `[7, 7, 7, 7]`, and `[3, -1, -5, -9]` are arithmetic sequences.
> * For example, `[1, 1, 2, 5, 7]` is not an arithmetic sequence.
>
> A **subsequence** of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.
> * For example, `[2,5,10]` is a subsequence of `[1,2,1,2,4,1,5,10]`.
>
> The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in **32-bit** integer.

 Example
-------

```sh
Input: nums = [2,4,6,8,10]
Output: 7
Explanation: All arithmetic subsequence slices are:
    [2,4,6]
    [4,6,8]
    [6,8,10]
    [2,4,6,8]
    [4,6,8,10]
    [2,4,6,8,10]
    [2,6,10]
```
