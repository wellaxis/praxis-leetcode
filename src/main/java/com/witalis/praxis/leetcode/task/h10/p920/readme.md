# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 920: [Number of Music Playlists][task]

Description
-----------

> Your music player contains `n` different songs.
> You want to listen to `goal` songs (not necessarily different) during your trip.
> To avoid boredom, you will create a playlist so that:
> * Every song is played **at least once**.
> * A song can only be played again only if `k` other songs have been played.
>
> Given `n`, `goal`, and `k`, return _the number of possible playlists that you can create_.
> Since the answer can be very large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: n = 3, goal = 3, k = 1
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 possible playlists: [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], and [3, 2, 1].
```
