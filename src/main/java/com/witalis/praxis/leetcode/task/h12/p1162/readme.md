# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 1162: [As Far from Land as Possible][task]

Description
-----------

> Given an `n x n` `grid` containing only values `0` and `1`, where `0` represents water and `1` represents land,
> find a water cell such that its distance to the nearest land cell is maximized, and return the distance.
> If no land or water exists in the grid, return `-1`.
> 
> The distance used in this problem is the Manhattan distance:
> the distance between two cells `(x0, y0)` and `(x1, y1)` is `|x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|`.
