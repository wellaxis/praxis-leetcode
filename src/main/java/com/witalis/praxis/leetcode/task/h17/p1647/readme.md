# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 1647: [Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique][task]

Description
-----------

> A string `s` is called **good** if there are no two different characters in `s` that have the same **frequency**.
> 
> Given a string `s`, return _the **minimum** number of characters you need to delete to make `s` **good**_.
> 
> The **frequency** of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string.
> For example, in the string `"aab"`, the **frequency** of `'a'` is `2`, while the **frequency** of `'b'` is `1`.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: s = "ceabaacb"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can delete both 'c's resulting in the good string "eabaab".
    Note that we only care about characters that are still in the string at the end (i.e. frequency of 0 is ignored).
```

Solution
--------
