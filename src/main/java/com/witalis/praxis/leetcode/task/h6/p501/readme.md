# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 501: [Find Mode in Binary Search Tree][task]

Description
-----------

> Given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates,
> return _all the `mode(s)` (i.e., the most frequently occurred element) in it_.
> 
> If the tree has more than one mode, return them in **any order**.
> 
> Assume a BST is defined as follows:
> * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than or equal to** the node's key.
> * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than or equal to** the node's key.
> * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
