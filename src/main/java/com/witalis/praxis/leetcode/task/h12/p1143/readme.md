# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 1143: [Longest Common Subsequence][task]

Description
-----------

> Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return _the length of their longest **common subsequence**_.
> If there is no **common subsequence**, return `0`.
> 
> A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none)
> deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
> * For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.
>
> A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```
