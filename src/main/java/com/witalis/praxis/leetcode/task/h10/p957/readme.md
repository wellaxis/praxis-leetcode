# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 957: [Check Completeness of a Binary Tree][task]

Description
-----------

> Given the `root` of a binary tree, determine if it is a _complete binary tree_.
> 
> In a [complete binary tree][tree], every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled,
> and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.
> It can have between `1` and `2^h` nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.

 Example
-------

```sh
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: true
Explanation:
    Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}),
    and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.
```
