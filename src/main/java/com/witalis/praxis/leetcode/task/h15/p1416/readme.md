# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 1416: [Restore The Array][task]

Description
-----------

> A program was supposed to print an array of integers. The program forgot to print whitespaces
> and the array is printed as a string of digits `s` and all we know is that all integers
> in the array were in the range `[1, k]` and there are no leading zeros in the array.
> 
> Given the string `s` and the integer `k`, return _the number of the possible arrays that can be printed
> as `s` using the mentioned program_. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: s = "1317", k = 2000
Output: 8
Explanation: Possible arrays are [1317],[131,7],[13,17],[1,317],[13,1,7],[1,31,7],[1,3,17],[1,3,1,7]
```
