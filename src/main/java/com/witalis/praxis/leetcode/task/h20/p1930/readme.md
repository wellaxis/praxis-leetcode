# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 1930: [Unique Length-3 Palindromic Subsequences][task]

Description
-----------

> Given a string `s`, return _the number of **unique palindromes of length three** that are a **subsequence** of `s`_.
> 
> Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted **once**.
> 
> A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.
> 
> A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none)
> deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
> 
> * For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: s = "aabca"
Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
    - "aba" (subsequence of "aabca")
    - "aaa" (subsequence of "aabca")
    - "aca" (subsequence of "aabca")
```

Solution
