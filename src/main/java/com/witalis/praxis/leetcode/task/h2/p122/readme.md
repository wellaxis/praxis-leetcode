> You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]`
> is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.
> 
> On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock.
> You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time.
> However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.
> 
> Find and return _the **maximum** profit you can achieve_.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation:
    Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
    Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
    Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
