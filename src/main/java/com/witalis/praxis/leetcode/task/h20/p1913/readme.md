# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 1913: [Maximum Product Difference Between Two Pairs][task]

Description
-----------

> The **product difference** between two pairs `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` is defined as `(a * b) - (c * d)`.
> 
> * For example, the product difference between `(5, 6)` and `(2, 7)` is `(5 * 6) - (2 * 7) = 16`.
>
> Given an integer array `nums`, choose four **distinct** indices `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` such that
> the **product difference** between pairs `(nums[w], nums[x])` and `(nums[y], nums[z])` is **maximized**.
> 
> Return _the **maximum** such product difference_.

 Example
-------

```sh
Input: nums = [4,2,5,9,7,4,8]
Output: 64
Explanation: We can choose indices 3 and 6 for the first pair (9, 8) and indices 1 and 5 for the second pair (2, 4).
    The product difference is (9 * 8) - (2 * 4) = 64.
```
