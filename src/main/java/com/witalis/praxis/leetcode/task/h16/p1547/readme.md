# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 1547: [Minimum Cost to Cut a Stick][task]

Description
-----------

> Given a wooden stick of length `n` units. The stick is labelled from `0` to `n`.
> For example, a stick of length **6** is labelled as follows:
> 
> ![stick.png](image/stick.png)
> 
> Given an integer array `cuts` where `cuts[i]` denotes a position you should perform a cut at.
> 
> You should perform the cuts in order, you can change the order of the cuts as you wish.
> 
> The cost of one cut is the length of the stick to be cut, the total cost is the sum of costs of all cuts.
> When you cut a stick, it will be split into two smaller sticks
> (i.e. the sum of their lengths is the length of the stick before the cut).
> Please refer to the first example for a better explanation.
> 
> Return _the minimum total cost of the cuts_.

Example
