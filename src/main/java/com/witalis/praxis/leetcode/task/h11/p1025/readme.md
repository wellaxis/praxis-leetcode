# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 1025: [Divisor Game][task]

Description
-----------

> Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.
> 
> Initially, there is a number `n` on the chalkboard. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:
> * Choosing any `x` with `0 < x < n` and `n % x == 0`.
> * Replacing the number `n` on the chalkboard with `n - x`.
> 
> Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.
> 
> Return _`true` if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally_.
