# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 1838: [Frequency of the Most Frequent Element][task]

Description
-----------

> The **frequency** of an element is the number of times it occurs in an array.
> 
> You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.
> In one operation, you can choose an index of `nums` and increment the element at that index by `1`.
> 
> Return _the **maximum possible frequency** of an element after performing **at most** `k` operations_.

 Example
-------

```sh
Input: nums = [1,4,8,13], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: There are multiple optimal solutions:
    - Increment the first element three times to make nums = [4,4,8,13]. 4 has a frequency of 2.
    - Increment the second element four times to make nums = [1,8,8,13]. 8 has a frequency of 2.
    - Increment the third element five times to make nums = [1,4,13,13]. 13 has a frequency of 2.
```
