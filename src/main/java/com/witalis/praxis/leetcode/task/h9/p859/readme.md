# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 859: [Buddy Strings][task]

Description
-----------

> Given two strings `s` and `goal`, return _`true` if you can swap two letters in `s`
> so the result is equal to `goal`, otherwise, return `false_`.
> 
> Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices `i` and `j` (0-indexed)
> such that `i != j` and swapping the characters at `s[i]` and `s[j]`.
> 
> * For example, swapping at indices `0` and `2` in `"abcd"` results in `"cbad"`.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: s = "ab", goal = "ba"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b' to get "ba", which is equal to goal.
```
