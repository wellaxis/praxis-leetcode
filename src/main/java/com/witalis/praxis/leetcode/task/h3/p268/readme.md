# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 268: [Missing Number][task]

Description
-----------

> Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`,
> return _the only number in the range that is missing from the array_.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9].
             8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```
