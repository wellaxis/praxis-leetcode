# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 2006: [Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Continuous][task]

Description
-----------

> You are given an integer array `nums`. In one operation, you can replace **any** element in `nums` with **any** integer.
> 
> `nums` is considered **continuous** if both of the following conditions are fulfilled:
> * All elements in `nums` are **unique**.
> * The difference between the **maximum** element and the **minimum** element in `nums` equals `nums.length - 1`.
> 
> For example, `nums = [4, 2, 5, 3]` is **continuous**, but `nums = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]` is **not continuous**.
> 
> Return _the **minimum** number of operations to make `nums` **continuous**_.

 Example
-------

```sh
Input: nums = [1,2,3,5,6]
Output: 1
Explanation: One possible solution is to change the last element to 4.
    The resulting array is [1,2,3,5,4], which is continuous.
```

Solution
