# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 235: [Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree][task]

Description
-----------

> Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA)
> of two given nodes in the BST.
> 
> According to the `definition of LCA on Wikipedia`:
> “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q`
> as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants
> (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”
