# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 1805: [Number of Different Integers in a String][task]

Description
-----------

> You are given a string `word` that consists of digits and lowercase English letters.
> 
> You will replace every non-digit character with a space. For example, `"a123bc34d8ef34"` will become `" 123  34 8  34"`.
> Notice that you are left with some integers that are separated by at least one space: `"123"`, `"34"`, `"8"`, and `"34"`.
> 
> Return _the number of **different** integers after performing the replacement operations on `word`_.
> 
> Two integers are considered different if their decimal representations **without any leading zeros** are different.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: word = "a123bc34d8ef34"
Output: 3
Explanation: The three different integers are "123", "34", and "8". Notice that "34" is only counted once.
```
