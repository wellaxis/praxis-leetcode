Description
-----------

> In a project, you have a list of required skills `req_skills`, and a list of people.
> The `i^th` person `people[i]` contains a list of skills that the person has.
> 
> Consider a sufficient team: a set of people such that for every required skill in `req_skills`,
> there is at least one person in the team who has that skill.
> We can represent these teams by the index of each person.
> * For example, `team = [0, 1, 3]` represents the people with skills `people[0]`, `people[1]`, and `people[3]`.
>
> Return _any sufficient team of the smallest possible size, represented by the index of each person_.
> You may return the answer in **any order**.
> 
> It is **guaranteed** an answer exists.
