# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 953: [Verifying an Alien Dictionary][task]

Description
-----------

> In an alien language, surprisingly, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different `order`.
> The `order` of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.
> 
> Given a sequence of `words` written in the alien language, and the `order` of the alphabet,
> return _`true` if and only if the given `words` are sorted lexicographically in this alien language_.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.
```
