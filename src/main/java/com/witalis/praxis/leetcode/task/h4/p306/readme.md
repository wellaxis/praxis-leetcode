# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 306: [Additive Number][task]

Description
-----------

> An **additive number** is a string whose digits can form an **additive sequence**.
> 
> A valid **additive sequence** should contain at least three numbers.
> Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.
> 
> Given a string containing only digits, return _`true` if it is an **additive number** or `false` otherwise_.
> 
> **Note**: Numbers in the additive sequence **cannot** have leading zeros,
> so sequence `1, 2, 03` or `1, 02, 3` is invalid.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: "112358"
Output: true
Explanation: 
The digits can form an additive sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. 
1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8
```
