# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 566: [Reshape the Matrix][task]

Description
-----------

> In MATLAB, there is a handy function called `reshape` which can reshape an `m x n` matrix
> into a new one with a different size `r x c` keeping its original data.
> 
> You are given an `m x n` matrix `mat` and two integers `r` and `c`
> representing the number of rows and the number of columns of the wanted re-shaped matrix.
> 
> The reshaped matrix should be filled with all the elements of the original matrix
> in the same row-traversing order as they were.
> 
> If the `reshape` operation with given parameters is possible and legal,
> output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.
