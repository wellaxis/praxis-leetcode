# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 413: [Arithmetic Slices][task]

Description
-----------

> An integer array is called arithmetic if it consists of **at least three elements**
> and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.
> 
> * For example, `[1,3,5,7,9]`, `[7,7,7,7]`, and `[3,-1,-5,-9]` are arithmetic sequences.
>
> Given an integer array `nums`, return _the number of arithmetic **subarrays** of `nums`_.
> 
> A **subarray** is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

 Example
-------

```sh
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: We have 3 arithmetic slices in nums: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1,2,3,4] itself.
```
