# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 594: [Longest Harmonious Subsequence][task]

Description
-----------

> We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference
> between its maximum value and its minimum value is **exactly** `1`.
> 
> Given an integer array `nums`, return _the length of its longest
> harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences_.
> 
> A **subsequence** of array is a sequence that can be derived from the array
> by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 Example
-------

```sh
Input: nums = [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].
```
