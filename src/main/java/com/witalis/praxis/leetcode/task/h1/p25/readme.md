# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 25: [Reverse Nodes in k-Group][task]

Description
-----------

> Given the `head` of a linked list,
> reverse the nodes of the list `k` at a time,
> and return the _modified list_.
> 
> `k` is a positive integer and is less than or equal
> to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes
> is not a multiple of `k` then left-out nodes, in the end,
> should remain as it is.
> 
> You may not alter the values in the list's nodes,
> only nodes themselves may be changed.
