# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 934: [Shortest Bridge][task]

Description
-----------

> You are given an `n x n` binary matrix `grid` where `1` represents land and `0` represents water.
> 
> An **island** is a 4-directionally connected group of `1`'s not connected to any other `1`'s.
> There are **exactly two islands** in `grid`.
> 
> You may change `0`'s to `1`'s to connect the two islands to form **one island**.
> 
> Return _the smallest number of `0`'s you must flip to connect the two islands_.
