# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 1403: [Minimum Subsequence in Non-Increasing Order][task]

Description
-----------

> Given the array `nums`, obtain a subsequence of the array whose sum of elements
> is **strictly greater** than the sum of the non-included elements in such subsequence.
> 
> If there are multiple solutions, return the subsequence with **minimum size** and if there still exist
> multiple solutions, return the subsequence with the **maximum total sum** of all its elements.
> A subsequence of an array can be obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.
> 
> Note that the solution with the given constraints is guaranteed to be **unique**.
> Also return the answer sorted in **non-increasing** order.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: nums = [4,3,10,9,8]
Output: [10,9] 
Explanation: The subsequences [10,9] and [10,8] are minimal
    such that the sum of their elements is strictly greater than the sum of elements not included.
    However, the subsequence [10,9] has the maximum total sum of its elements.
```

Solution
--------
