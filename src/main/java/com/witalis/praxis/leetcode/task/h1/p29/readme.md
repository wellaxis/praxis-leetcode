# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 29: [Divide Two Integers][task]

Description
-----------

> Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers
> without using multiplication, division, and mod operator.
> 
> The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part.
> For example, 8.345 would be truncated to 8, and -2.7335 would be truncated to -2.
>
> Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.
>
> Note: Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store
> integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31, 2^31 − 1].
> For this problem,
> if the quotient is strictly greater than 2^31 - 1, then return 2^31 - 1,
> and if the quotient is strictly less than -2^31, then return -2^31.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 10/3 = 3.33333.. which is truncated to 3.
```
