# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 872: [Leaf-Similar Trees][task]

Description
-----------

> Consider all the leaves of a binary tree, from left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.
> 
>> ![note.png](image/note.png)
> 
> For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is `(6, 7, 4, 9, 8)`.
> 
> Two binary trees are considered _leaf-similar_ if their leaf value sequence is the same.
> 
> Return `true` if and only if the two given trees with head nodes `root1` and `root2` are leaf-similar.
