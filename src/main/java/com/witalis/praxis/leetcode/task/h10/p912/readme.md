# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 912: [Sort an Array][task]

Description
-----------

> Given an array of integers `nums`, sort the array in ascending order and return it.
> 
> You must solve the problem **without using any built-in** functions in `O(nlog(n))` time complexity
> and with the smallest space complexity possible.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]
Output: [1,2,3,5]
Explanation: After sorting the array, the positions of some numbers are not changed (for example, 2 and 3),
    while the positions of other numbers are changed (for example, 1 and 5).
```
