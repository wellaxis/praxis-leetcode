# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 1458: [Max Dot Product of Two Subsequences][task]

Description
-----------

> Given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.
> 
> Return _the maximum dot product between **non-empty** subsequences of `nums1` and `nums2` with the same length_.
> 
> A subsequence of a array is a new array which is formed from the original array by deleting some (can be none)
> of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.
> (ie, `[2,3,5]` is a subsequence of `[1,2,3,4,5]` while `[1,5,3]` is not).

Example
-------

```sh
Input: nums1 = [2,1,-2,5], nums2 = [3,0,-6]
Output: 18
Explanation: Take subsequence [2,-2] from nums1 and subsequence [3,-6] from nums2.
    Their dot product is (2*3 + (-2)*(-6)) = 18.
```

Solution
