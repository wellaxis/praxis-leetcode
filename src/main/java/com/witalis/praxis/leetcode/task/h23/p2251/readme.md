> the `i^th` flower will be in **full bloom** from `start[i]` to `end[i]` (**inclusive**).
> You are also given a **0-indexed** integer array `people` of size `n`,
> where `people[i]` is the time that the `i^th` person will arrive to see the flowers.
> 
> Return _an integer array `answer` of size `n`, where `answer[i]` is
> the **number** of flowers that are in full bloom when the `i^th` person arrives_.
