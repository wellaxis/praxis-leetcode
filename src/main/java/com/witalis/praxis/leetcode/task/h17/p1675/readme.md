# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 1675: [Minimize Deviation in Array][task]

Description
-----------

> You are given an array `nums` of `n` positive integers.
> 
> You can perform two types of operations on any element of the array any number of times:
> * If the element is **even**, **divide** it by `2`.
> * * For example, if the array is `[1,2,3,4]`, then you can do this operation on the last element, and the array will be `[1,2,3,2]`.
> * If the element is **odd**, **multiply** it by `2`.
> * * For example, if the array is `[1,2,3,4]`, then you can do this operation on the first element, and the array will be `[2,2,3,4]`.
>
> The **deviation** of the array is the **maximum difference** between any two elements in the array.
> 
> Return _the **minimum deviation** the array can have after performing some number of operations_.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: nums = [4,1,5,20,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can transform the array after two operations to [4,2,5,5,3], then the deviation will be 5 - 2 = 3.
```
