# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 162: [Find Peak Element][task]

Description
-----------

> A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
> 
> Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index.
> If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.
> 
> You may imagine that `nums[-1]` = `nums[n]` = `-âˆž`. In other words, an element is always
> considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
> 
> You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

Example
-------

```sh
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2,
    or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
```
