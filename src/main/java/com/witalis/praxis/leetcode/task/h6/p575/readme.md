# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 575: [Distribute Candies][task]

Description
-----------

> Alice has `n` candies, where the `i^th` candy is of type `candyType[i]`.
> Alice noticed that she started to gain weight, so she visited a doctor.
> 
> The doctor advised Alice to only eat `n / 2` of the candies she has (`n` is always even).
> Alice likes her candies very much, and she wants to eat the maximum number
> of different types of candies while still following the doctor's advice.
> 
> Given the integer array `candyType` of length `n`,
> return _the **maximum** number of different types of candies she can eat if she only eats `n / 2` of them_.

 Example
-------

```sh
Input: candyType = [1,1,2,2,3,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: Alice can only eat 6 / 2 = 3 candies. Since there are only 3 types, she can eat one of each type.
```
