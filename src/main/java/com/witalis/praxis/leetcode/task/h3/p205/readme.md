Description
-----------

> Given two strings `s` and `t`, _determine if they are isomorphic_.
> 
> Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic
> if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.
> 
> All occurrences of a character must be replaced
> with another character while preserving the order of characters.
> No two characters may map to the same character,
> but a character may map to itself.
