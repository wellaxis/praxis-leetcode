# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 222: [Count Complete Tree Nodes][task]

Description
-----------

> Given the `root` of a **complete** binary tree, return _the number of the nodes in the tree_.
> 
> According to **Wikipedia**, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled
> in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.
> It can have between `1` and `2^h` nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.
> 
> Design an algorithm that runs in less than `O(n)` time complexity.
