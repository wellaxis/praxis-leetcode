Description
-----------

> You are given two jugs with capacities `jug1Capacity` and `jug2Capacity` liters.
> There is an infinite amount of water supply available.
> Determine whether it is possible to measure exactly `targetCapacity` liters using these two jugs.
> 
> If `targetCapacity` liters of water are measurable, you must have `targetCapacity` liters of water
> contained **within one or both buckets** by the end.
> 
> Operations allowed:
> * Fill any of the jugs with water.
> * Empty any of the jugs.
> * Pour water from one jug into another till the other jug is completely full, or the first jug itself is empty.
