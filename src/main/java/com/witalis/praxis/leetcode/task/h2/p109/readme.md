# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 109: [Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree][task]

Description
-----------

> Given the `head` of a singly linked list where elements are
> **sorted in ascending order**, convert it to a height balanced BST.
> 
> For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree
> in which the depth of the two subtrees of _every_ node never differ by more than 1.

 Example
