# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 1379: [Find a Corresponding Node of a Binary Tree in a Clone of That Tree][task]

Description
-----------

> Given two binary trees original and cloned
> and given a reference to a node target in the original tree.
>
> The cloned tree is a copy of the original tree.
>
> Return a reference to the same node in the cloned tree.
>
> Note that you are not allowed to change any of the two trees
> or the target node and the answer must be a reference to a node in the cloned tree.
