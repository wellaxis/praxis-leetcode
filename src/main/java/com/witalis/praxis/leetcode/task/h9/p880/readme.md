# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 880: [Decoded String at Index][task]

Description
-----------

> You are given an encoded string `s`. To decode the string to a tape,
> the encoded string is read one character at a time and the following steps are taken:
> * If the character read is a letter, that letter is written onto the tape.
> * If the character read is a digit `d`, the entire current tape is repeatedly written `d - 1` more times in total.
>
> Given an integer `k`, return _the `k^th` letter (**1-indexed**) in the decoded string_.

Example

```sh
Input: s = "leet2code3", k = 10
Output: "o"
