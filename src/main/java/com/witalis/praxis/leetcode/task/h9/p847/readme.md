# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 847: [Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes][task]

Description
-----------

> You have an undirected, connected graph of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`.
> You are given an array `graph` where `graph[i]` is a list of all the nodes connected with node `i` by an edge.
> 
> Return _the length of the shortest path that visits every node_.
> You may start and stop at any node, you may revisit nodes multiple times, and you may reuse edges.
