# [LeetCode][leetcode] task # 463: [Island Perimeter][task]

Description
-----------

> You are given `row x col` `grid` representing a map
> where `grid[i][j] = 1` represents land and `grid[i][j] = 0` represents water.
> 
> Grid cells are connected **horizontally/vertically** (not diagonally).
> The `grid` is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island
> (i.e., one or more connected land cells).
> 
> The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island.
> One cell is a square with side length 1.
> The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.
